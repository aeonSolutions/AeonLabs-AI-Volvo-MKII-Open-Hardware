# Open Hardware Electronics for the Volvo P2 platform
**current project Total: > 1350 work.h** <br>
<sup>Status: Ongoing Project </sup> <br>
[where to buy](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/PCB-Prototyping-Catalogue/wiki/Where-to-Buy) already assembled and ready to use.

⚠️ This project is delayed because all my tools and equipment including all the Volvo P2 modules and wiring got stolen from my workplace and apartment ⚠️

**The problem** <br>
&nbsp; Nowadays, repairing hardware electronics is impossible or almost impossible. Current practice forces a car owner to replace instead of repair. This has a really high cost and pushes owners to seek other less trustworthy solutions using components used in other vehicles. Since this type of component is nowadays heavily protected, maintenance and repair outside the official car manufacturer authorized dealer to pose additional risks every time a piece of hardware electronics or firmware requires reverse engineering and modification just to enable it and make it work in another vehicle. Furthermore, recurrently found good, fully functional cars, with the highest safety classification rating on their chassis, the [Euro NCAP 5 star rating](https://www.euroncap.com/en/about-euro-ncap/how-to-read-the-stars/) being sent to the scrap yard due to outdated electronics and components and a too low insurance valuation that limits repairability of the vehicle.    

**Summary** <br>
The overall objective of this open project is to extend the life of vehicles by means of updating them to current EU standards namely safety regulations and emission pollutants. As so vehicles undergo a process of refurbishment service and full-featured overhaul of technology updates from mechanical key components to the interior habitacle, comfort, and safety of a vehicle. Branded **Auto RFTI™** (refurbishment, facelift, and technology improvements) goes a step further than just a vehicle facelift and will differentiate by offering simple & easy hardware electronics and components for extending vehicle utilization life by means of technology upgrades to improve safety while at the same time reduce vehicle emissions.

In one sentence: 
<div align="center">

***"I'm solving all the electronics issues that make a P2 Volvo have a bad reputation"*** <br>

</div>

**Proof-of-Concept** <br>
&nbsp; Design and prototype OEM hardware electronics capable of the same operation and functionality for all Volvo's with the [common chassis P2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volvo_P2_platform), period 1998 to 2009 (S80, S60, V70 XC70, XC90), using the existing wiring on those cars (backward compatible). Instead of using closed and protected logic, it uses open hardware and open firmware hardware electronics as a direct replacement for existing* wiring in a vehicle, in particular older cars. This will facilitate repeatability and maintenance on any "repair shop" outside authorized dealers and requires no reverse engineering and no modification to make it work in a vehicle.<br>

&nbsp; To achieve this task I will be using the electronics and electrical wiring of a donor car I already have. This will serve as a ground base to commercialize automotive solutions using an open business logic (open hardware and open software) for other car brands and models. Including LPG systems.

<div align="center">

***"still.... even if it is not easily possible ...it will definitely going to be AWESOME running a car <br> that will meet the latest EURO emissions except on the pink slip"*** <br>

&nbsp; Since this is an open hardware project, the main selection of choice for the operating system will be Android Auto for the main LCD screen, in the center console. Nowadays there is a plenitude of "open auto" solutions using Raspberry Pi. I'll be designing the hardware electronics made to fit an SoC module, and I'll be starting with NVidia's Jetson Nano. In the following YouTube video, there's a good example of a traditional media unit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgbHXTHUnQw <br>

There are now 2 ways to navigate my hardware electronics catalog. The icons below will take you  to another page where this catalog is displayed using a conventional landing page design & styling. If you like code and more technical information, browse this page instead.
 
The icon to the left is suited to all those users who are only looking for a solution to a problem and not into the real technical details.  The icon to the right will take you directly to a webpage with all hardware electronics currently at the [M.V.P. stage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product). If you're not into technical information and are here only to buy, this is the option for you.

## What hardware electronics will be conceptualized, prototyped, and tested
&nbsp; The main objective of this project is to study the advantages of using open solutions and compare them with conventional hardware electronics solutions. In particular in regards to serviceability, maintenance, and repairability and also importantly, in regards to personal ownership safety. While driving and while parked (thieves).
