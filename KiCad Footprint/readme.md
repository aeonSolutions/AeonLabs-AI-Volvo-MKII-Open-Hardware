This folder contains the KiCad footprints for this project's open hardware electronics, available with a [creative commons share alike non-commercial license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/deed.en) .  Each footprint was carefully measured and It has the exact factory measurements and dimensions as the ones found on Volvo P2 models. However, they're not fully complete. If you like it and are looking to use it on your projects, you can download a complete Kicad Footprint by this project with a one-time donation, [click here](https://github.com/sponsors/aeonSolutions) to learn how,  and don't forget to include in a message which footprint you need. <br> Thank you 🙏.
